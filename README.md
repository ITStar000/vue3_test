### Objective
Lets implement a prototype that allows users to effectively learn from knowledge graph. Think of an Wikipedia alternative.

- User starts with main doc
- Can browse related document by clicking on linked terms document content
- A click on a link open new docs but doesn't close already opened documents - stacks it instead to tabs on the left side
- All the time there's an option to return back to any previously stacked document - by scrolling and clicking on any stacked tab

This way users can learn more effectively - read docs and anytime they found a new topic, dive down, absorb it and then continue with the main line. 

Our designer has [sketched a solution](https://www.figma.com/file/6F4oYTMn756ZFLp1j4DWNj/WithVision-Assigment?node-id=0%3A1). 
Would you be able to create a working prototype?

### Notes
- You should use Vue3 as frontend framework 
- Typescript and Composition API are recommended
- (Optional) For storage of data you can use any database / adapter you want (localstorage, firestore...).
- (Optional) For styling you can use any framework of your choice - TailwindCSS is preferred

### Evaluation Criteria
- Implementation of the design doesn't needs to be pixel - perfect
- UX of your solution should feel comfortable
- Technically we're quite curios about collapse/expand UX

### Next step
Create a PR into this repo and we'll review your solution
